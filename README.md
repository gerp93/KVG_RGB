# OpenRGB Python Development Environment

This project provides Python scripts for controlling RGB devices using OpenRGB with a professional CLI interface.

## Features

- üé® Control all your RGB devices from the command line
- üåà Built-in effects (rainbow, breathing)
- üîß Extensible architecture for future GUI development
- üì¶ Can be packaged as standalone executable for sharing
- üéõÔ∏è Zone management - resize addressable RGB zones on compatible devices


## Installation

### Option 1: Install as Command-Line Tool (Recommended)

Install the package in development mode to use it from anywhere:

```powershell
# Navigate to the project directory
cd C:\Users\kgerp\source\repos\KVG_RGB

# Activate virtual environment
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install the package
pip install -e .
```

Now you can use `kvg-rgb` command from anywhere in your terminal!

```powershell
kvg-rgb list
kvg-rgb color 255 0 0
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. **Virtual Environment**: A Python virtual environment has been created in the `venv` folder.

2. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   ```powershell
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```

3. **Dependencies are already installed**, but if you need to reinstall:
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Prerequisites

- **OpenRGB** must be installed and running
- **SDK Server** must be enabled in OpenRGB:
  - Open OpenRGB
  - Go to Settings (gear icon)
  - Enable "Start SDK Server"
  - Default port is 6742

## Files

### Package Structure
- `kvg_rgb/` - Main package folder
  - `__init__.py` - Package initialization
  - `core.py` - Core RGB controller class (reusable by CLI or GUI)
  - `cli.py` - Command-line interface
- `main.py` - Entry point script
- `rgb_utils.py` - Legacy utility functions (for reference)
- `requirements.txt` - Production dependencies
- `requirements-dev.txt` - Development dependencies (PyInstaller)
- `build_exe.py` - Script to build standalone executable

## Usage

### Command-Line Interface

```powershell
# Show all available commands
kvg-rgb --help

# List all RGB devices
kvg-rgb list

# View devices with their zones and LED counts
kvg-rgb zones

# Resize a zone (e.g., device 1, zone 3, to 35 LEDs)
kvg-rgb resize 1 3 35

# Set all devices to red
kvg-rgb color 255 0 0

# Set specific device to green (use device index from list command)
kvg-rgb color 0 255 0 --device 0

# Run rainbow effect for 30 seconds
kvg-rgb rainbow --duration 30

# Run rainbow effect on specific device with custom speed
kvg-rgb rainbow --duration 60 --speed 2.0 --device 1

# Run breathing effect (cyan)
kvg-rgb breathe 0 150 255

# Run breathing effect with custom duration and speed
kvg-rgb breathe 255 0 0 --duration 45 --speed 1.5
```

### Zone Management

Many RGB devices (especially motherboards) have addressable RGB headers with resizable zones. You can view and resize these zones using the CLI:

```powershell
# View all devices with their zones
kvg-rgb zones

# Example output:
# [Device 1] ASUS PRIME Z890-P WIFI
#   Total LEDs: 96
#   Zones: 4
#
#   Zone Details:
#     [Zone 0] Aura Mainboard - 1 LED
#     [Zone 1] Aura Addressable 1 - 30 LEDs
#     [Zone 2] Aura Addressable 2 - 30 LEDs
#     [Zone 3] Aura Addressable 3 - 35 LEDs

# Resize a zone: kvg-rgb resize <device_index> <zone_index> <new_size>
kvg-rgb resize 1 3 50  # Resize device 1, zone 3 to 50 LEDs

# Interactive zone manager (standalone script)
python zone_manager.py
```

**Note**: Zone resizing is useful when you've added or removed RGB strips from your motherboard's addressable headers. Not all zones can be resized - it depends on the device capabilities.

### Using as Python Module

```python
from kvg_rgb.core import RGBController

# Connect to OpenRGB
with RGBController() as controller:
    # Get all devices
    devices = controller.get_devices()
    
    # Set all devices to purple
    controller.set_color(128, 0, 128)
    
    # Run rainbow effect for 10 seconds
    controller.rainbow_effect(duration=10, speed=1.5)
```

## Available Commands & Functions

### CLI Commands

- `list` - List all RGB devices with basic info
- `zones` - List all devices with detailed zone information
- `resize <device> <zone> <size>` - Resize a specific zone
- `color <r> <g> <b>` - Set device(s) to a solid color
- `rainbow` - Run rainbow cycling effect
- `breathe <r> <g> <b>` - Run breathing/pulsing effect

### Python API

See `kvg_rgb/core.py` for the full RGBController class:

- `get_devices()` - Get list of all RGB devices
- `set_color(r, g, b, device_index=None)` - Set device(s) to a color
- `rainbow_effect(duration, speed, device_index=None)` - Rainbow cycling effect
- `breathing_effect(r, g, b, duration, speed, device_index=None)` - Breathing/pulsing effect

See `kvg_rgb/cli.py` for CLI-specific functions:

- `list_devices()` - List all devices
- `list_zones()` - List devices with zone details
- `resize_zone_command(args)` - Resize a zone
- `set_color_command(args)` - Set color command handler
- `rainbow_command(args)` - Rainbow effect command handler
- `breathe_command(args)` - Breathing effect command handler

## Building Standalone Executable

To create a shareable `.exe` file that doesn't require Python:

```powershell
# Activate venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install PyInstaller
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Build the executable
python build_exe.py
```

The executable will be created in `dist\kvg-rgb.exe`. You can:
- Copy it to a folder in your PATH (like `C:\Windows\`)
- Share it with others (they don't need Python or OpenRGB SDK installed)
- Run it from anywhere: `kvg-rgb.exe list`

## Troubleshooting

If you get a connection error:
1. Make sure OpenRGB is running
2. Check that SDK Server is enabled in OpenRGB settings
3. Verify the port (default: 6742)
