# OpenRGB Python Development Environment

This project provides Python scripts for controlling RGB devices using OpenRGB with a professional CLI interface.

## Features

- ðŸŽ¨ Control all your RGB devices from the command line
- ðŸŒˆ Built-in effects (rainbow, breathing)
- ðŸ”§ Extensible architecture for future GUI development
- ðŸ“¦ Can be packaged as standalone executable for sharing


## Installation

### Option 1: Install as Command-Line Tool (Recommended)

Install the package in development mode to use it from anywhere:

```powershell
# Navigate to the project directory
cd C:\Users\kgerp\source\repos\KVG_RGB

# Activate virtual environment
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install the package
pip install -e .
```

Now you can use `kvg-rgb` command from anywhere in your terminal!

```powershell
kvg-rgb list
kvg-rgb color 255 0 0
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. **Virtual Environment**: A Python virtual environment has been created in the `venv` folder.

2. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   ```powershell
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```

3. **Dependencies are already installed**, but if you need to reinstall:
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Prerequisites

- **OpenRGB** must be installed and running
- **SDK Server** must be enabled in OpenRGB:
  - Open OpenRGB
  - Go to Settings (gear icon)
  - Enable "Start SDK Server"
  - Default port is 6742

## Files

### Package Structure
- `kvg_rgb/` - Main package folder
  - `__init__.py` - Package initialization
  - `core.py` - Core RGB controller class (reusable by CLI or GUI)
  - `cli.py` - Command-line interface
- `main.py` - Entry point script
- `rgb_utils.py` - Legacy utility functions (for reference)
- `requirements.txt` - Production dependencies
- `requirements-dev.txt` - Development dependencies (PyInstaller)
- `build_exe.py` - Script to build standalone executable

## Usage

### Command-Line Interface

```powershell
# Show all available commands
kvg-rgb --help

# List all RGB devices
kvg-rgb list

# Set all devices to red
kvg-rgb color 255 0 0

# Set specific device to green (use device index from list command)
kvg-rgb color 0 255 0 --device 0

# Run rainbow effect for 30 seconds
kvg-rgb rainbow --duration 30

# Run rainbow effect on specific device with custom speed
kvg-rgb rainbow --duration 60 --speed 2.0 --device 1

# Run breathing effect (cyan)
kvg-rgb breathe 0 150 255

# Run breathing effect with custom duration and speed
kvg-rgb breathe 255 0 0 --duration 45 --speed 1.5
```

### Using as Python Module

```python
from kvg_rgb.core import RGBController

# Connect to OpenRGB
with RGBController() as controller:
    # Get all devices
    devices = controller.get_devices()
    
    # Set all devices to purple
    controller.set_color(128, 0, 128)
    
    # Run rainbow effect for 10 seconds
    controller.rainbow_effect(duration=10, speed=1.5)
```

## Available Utility Functions

See `kvg_rgb/core.py` for the full RGBController class:

- `get_devices()` - Get list of all RGB devices
- `set_color(r, g, b, device_index=None)` - Set device(s) to a color
- `rainbow_effect(duration, speed, device_index=None)` - Rainbow cycling effect
- `breathing_effect(r, g, b, duration, speed, device_index=None)` - Breathing/pulsing effect

## Building Standalone Executable

To create a shareable `.exe` file that doesn't require Python:

```powershell
# Activate venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install PyInstaller
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Build the executable
python build_exe.py
```

The executable will be created in `dist\kvg-rgb.exe`. You can:
- Copy it to a folder in your PATH (like `C:\Windows\`)
- Share it with others (they don't need Python or OpenRGB SDK installed)
- Run it from anywhere: `kvg-rgb.exe list`

## Troubleshooting

If you get a connection error:
1. Make sure OpenRGB is running
2. Check that SDK Server is enabled in OpenRGB settings
3. Verify the port (default: 6742)
