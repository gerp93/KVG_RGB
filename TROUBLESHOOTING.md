# Release Process - What Went Wrong & How It's Fixed

## Issue You Encountered
The `release.ps1` script completed but **didn't create the `.exe` file**.

## Root Cause
PyInstaller wasn't installed in your virtual environment. The `build_exe.py` script failed silently during the release process.

## What We Fixed
Updated `release.ps1` to:
1. **Install PyInstaller automatically** (`pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`)
2. Better error handling to catch build failures
3. Clear step-by-step output so you know what's happening

## ✅ It's Fixed Now!

Your executable was successfully created: **`dist\kvg-rgb.exe`** (8.6 MB)

## Testing Your Executable

```powershell
# Test the help menu
.\dist\kvg-rgb.exe --help

# List your devices
.\dist\kvg-rgb.exe list

# Set a color
.\dist\kvg-rgb.exe color 255 0 0
```

## Next Release - It Will Work Automatically

Next time you run `.\release.ps1`, it will:
1. Auto-install PyInstaller if needed
2. Build both the `.exe` AND Python packages
3. Show clear output for each step

## Current Distribution Files

After running the release process, you now have:

```
dist/
├── kvg-rgb.exe                        # 8.6 MB - Standalone executable
├── kvg_rgb-0.1.1-py3-none-any.whl    # Python wheel package
└── kvg-rgb-0.1.1.tar.gz              # Source distribution
```

**For end users**: Share `kvg-rgb.exe`
**For Python developers**: Share the `.whl` or upload to PyPI

---

## Reminder: First-Time Setup Requirement

The **first time** you build an executable on a new machine, you must install PyInstaller:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

The updated `release.ps1` now does this automatically! ✅
